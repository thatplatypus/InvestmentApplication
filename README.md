# Running the Example Investment Application
The application will need to download required packages.

## Clone the Repository
In the project directory run ``` npm i```
Once that is finished, the app should be ready to launch. 
The project can also be opened in an IDE of choice, such as Visual Studio to run the application.

## Run ``` npm start ``` from the Command Line
If it does not open in a browser, open one and go to http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. That port has been configured as the local port to run the application on.

## Description
This is a sample react application that has a form to intake some data to validate a potential investment, and then returns success or failure depending on the inputs.
